Currently, memory management could use some work.  The Object vector is storing Objects based on their ID, but the vector does not dynamically resize very well
if say an Object was deleted, it will be an empty hole in the vector and remain there throughout the length of the program occupying memory.
Linked List?
Vector of pointers

Textwriter is probably messing everything up.
